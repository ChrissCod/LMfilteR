Description: We present a method based on filtering algorithms to estimate the parameters of linear regressions, i.e. the coefficients and the variance of the error term. The proposed algorithm makes use of Particle Filters following Ristic, B., Arulampalam, S., Gordon, N. (2004, ISBN: 158053631X) resampling methods.
